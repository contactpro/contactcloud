Here are the STEPS:

1. Click on the LINK https://tinyurl.com/CONTACT-MANAGEMENT-EXPERT 
to see my Google Drive with the INSTALLER FILE in there.

2. Download the INSTALLER FILE from my Google Drive - 
Be Patient because the 8 Mb File takes about 15 seconds to download.

3. Go to your DOWNLOAD Folder on your PC and COPY this 
file to whatever Folder you want -- create a Folder 
and PASTE the INSTALLER File in the new Folder.
I suggest creating a Folder called .../CM_INSTALLER_v1_64Bit/

4. Next, (Important) Create a Folder where you 
have WRITE Permission. This is usually on the C Drive 
at C:\MY_NEW_FOLDER_NAME\ (Create Folder Name Yourself)
I suggest this Folder be called something like C:/CM_APP_AREA/

5. Go back to the Folder where you SAVED the INSTALLER FILE 
(that we copied from DOWNLOADS, and Double Click on the Installer,
in that Folder called .../CM_INSTALLER_v1_64Bit/

6. When the INSTALLER asks you to Select the Insallation Path, 
Select the Path of the NEW FOLDER you just created, 
something like C:/CM_APP_AREA/  then click NEXT and wait for 
the Installer to INSTALL the Contact Manager App.
IMPORTANT: It is very important to change or modify the
path that the installer presents to you in the window
from C:/Programs/ to C:/CM_APP_AREA/  so the Contact Management
application has write permission to create data files.

7. Locate the File: contact_management_python.exe 
in the Folder C:/CM_APP_AREA/ and double click it to see it run OK. 
Then go back and RIGHT CLICK on that same file contact_management_python.exe 
and select PIN TO START MENU. (You can also create a shortcut 
for contact_management_python.exe and place the shortcut on your desktop.
