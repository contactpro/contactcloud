   https://tinyurl.com/CONTACT-MANAGEMENT-EXPERT

   Here are the STEPS:

1. Click on the LINK https://tinyurl.com/CONTACT-MANAGEMENT-EXPERT 
   to see my Google Drive with the INSTALLER FILE in there.

2. Download the INSTALLER FILE from my Google Drive - 
   The File only takes about 15 to 20 seconds to download.
   The Installer File is called CM-10.0-amd64 and it will
   be located in your Downloads Folder on your Windows 10 PC.

3. Go to your DOWNLOAD Folder on your PC and COPY this Installer
   file you just downloaded to whatever Folder you want.
   Create a Folder and PASTE the INSTALLER File in the new Folder.
   I suggest creating a Windows Folder called .../CM_INSTALLER_VERSION_10

4. Double Click on the Installer File (or right click and select Install).
   The Installer will prompt you with a textbox where you have the
   option to change the Windows Folder where the application 
   is installed. You can just select OK to continue installing
   at the default path (the Windows Program Files Folder called 
   CM) or select a folder name you specify).

5. Locate the File: contact_management_python.exe 
   in the Folder the Windows Program Files Folder CM
   or select a folder name you specified, and double click 
   on this contact_management_python.exe to see it run OK. 
   Then go back and RIGHT CLICK on that same file: contact_management_python.exe 
   and select PIN TO START MENU. (You can also create a shortcut 
   for contact_management_python.exe and place the shortcut on your desktop).
